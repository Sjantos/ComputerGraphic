Repository for college course containing all exercises

All programs are made in **old OpenGL**.
Lab1-Lab5 are small projects, the course ended with a project, which can be found in **GKProject**.
This project contain all knowledge from laboratories and some more, because it uses C# and OpenTK library.

Projects Lab1-Lab5 are programs for classes, some of them use OpenGl from package (by NuGet),
some use dll pasted into VS2015 folders. Code uses functions from course website [a link](http://www.zsk.iiar.pwr.wroc.pl/zsk/dyd/intinz/gk/lab/).
Code may be a bit chaotic, due to deadlines.
